            Review_Text: "I cannot say enough amazing things about this walking tour with Amitylux. Our guide was incredible and had so much local knowledge. She made it so outstanding. Our group was small so we were constantly asking questions and learned so much about Copenhagen, hygge, and the amazing people of this beautiful country. Thank you! :)",

            Review_Text: "Had a great tour with our guide Mary today. It was a very small group which made it very personal and relaxed. We saw things that were off the usual touristy routes which was great and our guide had an excellent knowledge of Danish history and culture. I think this tour is excellent value for money and would highly recommend it!",

            Review_Text: "What a great tour we had!! Our guide was very friendly and knowledgeable and we enjoyed walking and chatting about the many different aspects of Copenhagen, including of course the famous Hygge We visited several places that are off the usual tourist trail and we also enjoyed tasting some typical Danish food and drink. I wish we had done the whole day tour as there is so much more to see. I would recommend this tour to anyone looking to learn about this capital city, its culture and traditions.",
